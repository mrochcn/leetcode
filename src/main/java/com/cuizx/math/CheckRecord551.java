 * You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:
 *
 * 'A': Absent.
 * 'L': Late.
 * 'P': Present.
 * The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
 *
 * The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
 * The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
 * Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.
